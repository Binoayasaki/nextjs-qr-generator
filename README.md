### How It Works

- When you save a QR code, it is stored in MongoDB.
- You can retrieve your saved codes anytime by logging into your account.

## Customization Options

The Next.js QR Generator allows users to customize their QR codes in several ways:

- **Colors**: Choose from a palette to set the background and foreground colors.
